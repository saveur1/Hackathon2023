What is descriptive analytics?

Descriptive analytics is a type of data analytics that looks at past data to give an account of what has happened. Results are typically presented in reports, dashboards, bar charts and other visualizations that are easily understood.

Descriptive statistics provide simple summaries about the sample and about the observations that have been made. Such summaries may be either quantitative, i.e. summary statistics, or visual, i.e. simple-to-understand graphs. These summaries may either form the basis of the initial description of the data as part of a more extensive statistical analysis, or they may be sufficient in and of themselves for a particular investigation.
